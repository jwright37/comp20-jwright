Assignment 6 : Security

Note: I used tokens for this assignment

I found this assignment very difficult because of my limited knowledge of 
web security and the apparent lack of documentation on good security testing.
The tools like Burp Suite and Paros were a little helpful, but most of their 
functionality was over my head and I felt like I was mostly just bumping around
in the dark. 

I did learn more about how HTTP protocols work through this assignment, and I 
definitely figured out certain programming practices that I should not use, but
I am still not entirely sure how to write solid, secure code for the web. 

Looking at another student's code was very helpful for discovering other ways
to address assignment 5. 

I spent about 7 hours on this assignment between actually writting the report
and reading up on various security topics. I collaborated with Brett, Jake, 
McCall, and Ann on some of it because we were meeting anyway for our group 
project. I did not really work with Will Parker or Nick Davis besides email
correspondance and talking after class.
