I used JS to make the updates on FB. Syntax is very intuitive because it is similar to C++ 
and there are libraries for pretty much everything. 
With just a little google-ing I could find all the resources I needed to make the site. 

I didn't really get stuck on any particular parts. W3schools is awesome and I went to their sites for syntax help.
