This assignment was similar to 10 labs all stiched together into one project. 
It required lots of googling and RTFMing, which was good practice but also very
frustrating because I never really had a good idea of what I was doing. I had lots
of fun with everything regarding the google maps api because it made the project 
much easier and I am impressed with how they have all those libraries publically 
availible. 

The most difficult part was scoping issues and passing variables around without 
messing up. 

I spent about 2 full days working on this assignment (20 hours).

I spoke with Brett, Jake, Ann, and McCall (basically my whole group project team)
about how they were solving the problems and what to google.
