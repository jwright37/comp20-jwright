Frogger Part II

For the second part of frogger, I rearranged all of the part one code to make the background look good. My code for this project was much longer that I expected, so I am sure that there are more efficient ways to do many of the functions. I also spent a bunch of hours on this and took a token. I am still on campus and all my friends left. It is really quiet. And kind of creepy. 

The main parts that gave me trouble were making the frog jump the right distance, detecting collisions, and reseting the frog when he dies correctly. There are still some bugs when the frog dies midjump and continues jumping after being reset. 

For the three additional requirements, I chose the fly, the level incrementation, and the dead frog animation. The fly is placed with the Fly() function. It randomly chooses a slot to put itself in and stays in that slot for a random amount of time before it switches to another slot. The level incrementation just speeds every object up at the end of a level. The dead frog animaiton draws the dead_frog.png at the bottom of the screen when the player dies. 

The game was super laggy when I ran it on Firefox, but it runs smoothly in Chrome. If I had more time to optimize and compress the code, I am sure it would run better on other browsers.
