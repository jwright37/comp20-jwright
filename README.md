This repo is for use with Web Programming (Comp 20) at Tufts University, taught my Ming Chow. It served as a git repository for all of our class's projects and labs.
</p><p>
My favorite project of this course was making a working version of Frogger. I thought that making a working HTML5 game was very fun and taught me a lot about game design and writing code that could run well on the web.
</p><p>
The assignment that I am most proud of from this course is Assignment 4, which is Frogger. This class was awesome because we could take away concrete examples of what we learned, and Frogger is my favorite project to show off to my friends.

I became much better at doing research and finding resources to teach myself material through taking this course. We covered many topics and sometimes I had to learn about things with only the help of the internet and my friends. Although this was frustrating at times, it made me more competent at working with programming languages and concepts that I had little experience with.
