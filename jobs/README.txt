README for Lab7
John Wright

Reusing most of my code from the previous lab made this lab much easier.
Once I found the documentation for the XMLHttpRequest object, this project
wasn't too bad. I used the same parsing and printing functions from lab7.
I used the error catching code from class to post an error alert when the
heroku page throws a 404 error. I used the same styling as lab7.
